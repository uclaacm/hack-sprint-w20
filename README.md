# Hack Sprint Resources - Winter 2019

## Welcome to Hack Sprint!

We learn a lot of things in CS classes at UCLA, but often times it's hard to see the practical application of what we're learning. Through Hack Sprint, we're hoping to bridge that gap, and show you all how to make an app over the next quarter. 
Over the next nine weeks, we'll hold a combination of learning, hacking, and presenting sessions, all with the goal of learning Android development through Kotlin!

The six learning sessions will take place from Week 2 - Week 7 and will cover all of the basics of Kotlin and Android Studio Each session will build upon the last and mentors will be available to help you whenever needed. We really want this to be a fun and social experience because learning is collaborative! So we'll be having things like dinners or maye even study sessions as a group!

In this repository, you'll find a guidemap to all the topics we introduce this quarter, and links to helpful resources.

We hope you have a lot of fun this quarter, and please reach out to any of us if you have any questions or comments. Post any questions you may have to our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1399200097134287/).
